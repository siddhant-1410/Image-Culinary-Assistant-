      "59. I tried this with 1 serving quantities and it came out well. I could not grind the cumin seeds thoroughly due to the low amounts I had to put. But overall felt very happy to get a new recipe for lunch box as every-time if I make normal pulav and biryani it will become boring\n",
      "60. Nice to know and thanks. A tip is that instead of cumin seeds, you can add cumin powder. Thanks for the rating too.\n",
      "61. When I cooked the dish, i followed the instructions – but the potatoes were not cooked at all by the end. Should I par-boil the potatoes before cooking in future?\n",
      "62. okay. usually the potatoes cook well. 2 to 3 whistles if enough for chopped potatoes to cook properly. also depending on the quality of potatoes, they may take more time to cook. at times i have this issue with cauliflower that i get here. you can parboil the potatoes or chop them in small cubes. both the methods will work.\n",
      "63. hi,can i use jeera powder in the masala paste because whole jeera will not grind well in my grinder.\n",
      "64. yes you can do this way too. so jeera powder can be used instead of whole jeera.\n",
      "65. hi, super recipe.. jjst wanted to know what to do if I want the rice to be bit more spicy/\n",
      "66. apeksha, just add more green chilies while grinding or use hot green chilies.\n",
